-Gameplay-
Gameplay is identical to traditional Cluedo. 

At the start, choose the number of players (3-6).
Each player inputs their name and selects their desired character.
Each turn, the current player's hand is displayed on the right. They roll a die and click on the board to move to their desired location. If they end their turn inside a room, they can make a suggestion about that room, a weapon, and a player of their choice. Chosen player is teleported to that room.

When a player is confident they have deduced the correct answer, they can make an accusation. If correct, they win, if not, they are eliminated from the game.
